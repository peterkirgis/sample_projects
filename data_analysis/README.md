# Data Analysis

This folder holds three sets of RMarkdown and PDF files used in data analyses I've conducted.

1. `MassDataFile.Rmd`: This RMarkdown and accompanying PDF were used in a project to compile a descriptive analysis of patterns in food establishment violations in the city of Boston. The challenge in the project was figuring out how to deal with the frequency of "re-inspections" for the purposes of determining progress or failure, as this was not an attribute of the dataset.
2. `FamilyShelter2011_2020.Rmd` & `IndividualShelter.Rmd`: These files are comprehensive descriptive analyses of two homeless shelter populations that I conducted while serving as an AmeriCorps VISTA.
