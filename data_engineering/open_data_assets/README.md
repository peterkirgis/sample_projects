# Open Data Assets

This folder holds `acessible_excel.py` and `privacy_intervals.py` which are two python functions I used in multiple projects while at the Comonwealth of Masschusetts.

`accessible_excel.py` takes a pandas dataframe and converts it to an accessible excel workbook given a set of parameters which determines the name of the workbook, file path, sheet names, and dataframes to be used.

`privacy_intervals.py` privatizes a dataset using a generalization approach. The function works by replacing an integer value for a count or summary statistic with a text field of a range specified by the user.
