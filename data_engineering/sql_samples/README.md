# SQL Samples

This folder holds a set of SQL scripts that were used to create live data connections from a Redshift database with HR Data to a set of Power BI workbooks to show relevant internal KPIs. The selected SQL scripts in this folder support visualizations showing retention rates and employment trajectories for new hires in the past three years broken out by office and quarterly turnover rates. The other file, org_chart.sql, is used to build a dynamic org chart in Power BI.
